A docker image is available on dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/drivereu/ost-app

Image with database to store backend for OST:
itti_db
    image: drivereu/ost-app:itti_database
    ports:
    - "EXTERNAL_PORT:5432" <-- e.g 5437
    volumes:
    - ost-database:/var/lib/postgresql/data <-- volume to save database
    restart: always

Image with frontend and nginx configuration:
itti_web

    links:
    - itti_api <-- needs to be connected to OST backend (Apache Tomcat service)
    ports:

    restart: always

Image with backend (Apache Tomcat service):
itti_api
    image: drivereu/ost-app:itti_backend
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_URL: broker:9092 <-- backend needs to have mapping to testbed broker on internal port 9092
    depends_on:
    - itti_db <-- backend is using Postgres to store data and services
    ports:
    - "EXTERNAL_PORT:8080" <-- e.g 8084
    restart: always

Additional info:
OST is searching for kafka broker on port 3501 and schema registry on port 3502 (this is configured inside ost_backend container: /opt/config/)

Build project with:
docker-compose up -d

Using the OST
Open a browser and visit the OST home page with 127.0.0.1:84.
DO NOT use localhost:84, as this will not work - the GUI then tries to connect to an internal service running at ITTI, which is not accessible.
To login, use the following credentials: admin19/adminpass
