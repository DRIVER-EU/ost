A docker image is available on dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/drivereu/ost-app

Image with database to store backend for OST:
itti_db
    image: drivereu/ost-app:itti_database
    ports:
    - "EXTERNAL_PORT:5432" <-- e.g 5437
    volumes:
    - ost-database:/var/lib/postgresql/data <-- volume to save database
    restart: always

Image with frontend and nginx configuration:
itti_web
    image: drivereu/ost-app:itti_frontend
    links:
    - itti_api <-- needs to be connected to OST backend (Apache Tomcat service)
    ports:
    - "EXTERNAL_PORT:80" <-- e.g 84
    restart: always

Image with backend (Apache Tomcat service):
itti_api
    image: drivereu/ost-app:itti_backend
    environment:
    - SERVER_NAME=itti <-- it is needed to create self-signed certificate, you can specify there IP or DNS of your machine
    links:
    - itti_db <-- backend is using Postgres to store data and services
    ports:
    - "EXTERNAL_PORT:8080" <-- e.g 8084
    restart: always

Additional info:
1.OST is searching for kafka broker on port 3501 and schema registry on port 3502. 
    This is configured inside ost_backend container in: /opt/config/). If you want to change kafka/schema_registry ip:port run:
    docker exec -it [CONTAINER_API_NAME] bash
    cd /opt/config
    Edit consumer.properties, producer.properties files
2. If you want you can declare SERVER_NAME environment for itti_api in docker-compose, e.g:
    `environment:
    - SERVER_NAME=IP_ADDR or DNS`
    It is used in creating self-signed certificate for your IP or DNS.
3. DO NOT start OST on localhost, as this will not work - the GUI then tries to connect to an internal service running at ITTI, which is not accessible. Use 127.0.0.1:PORT or IP_ADDR of your machine
4. OST NEEDS to work on SSL certificate.
5. DO NOT use Google Chrome browser as this is not operate self-signed certificate.
6. To login, use following credentials: admin19/adminpass

Build project with:
docker-compose up -d
Open browser and visit the OST home page with 127.0.0.1:PORT or YOUR_IP_ADDR:PORT
