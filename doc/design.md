## OST and Test-bed Integration
There exists integration between Observer Support Tool Server and Test-Bed as an external system. Test-bed prepares data about events: names, description, trigger and time. Packages with that information are sent to OST Server. OST Server provides reacting on a trigger and displaying correctly events in time to user. 
In fact not only Test-bed is responsible for sending events. There is also possibility that Trial Manager sends such packages directly to users. 
Events with information about them and time are called Simulation Phases. 

### Events sent by Test-bed
Firstly OST Server has to subscribe Test-bed. Each time when new event is prepare, OST server receives a notification about it and forwards this message to Trial Manager and User.
